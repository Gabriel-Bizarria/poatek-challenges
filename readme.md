<h1>Poatek Challenges - How to access the challenges?</h1>
<p>
These challenges were built in Kotlin through Intellij IDEA.
To run it, you need to install the IDEA in this 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download">link
</a> and choose the Community Edition.
</p>
<p>
After you installed the program and clone this repository into your own computer, 
you need to enter the IDEA, and open the cloned file. To do this, in the IDEA 
opened, go in File, on the top left, then click Open, and in the window, find 
where you cloned the repository and open it. After that it might start downloading
some Gradle files, and you might need to install the <i>JDK</i>(Java Development 
Kit) 16 too, but the IDEA does it all automatically.
