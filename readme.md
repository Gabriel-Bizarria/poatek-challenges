###Poatek Challenges - How to access the challenges?
<p>
These challenges were built in Kotlin through Intellij IDEA.
To run it, you need to install the IDEA in this 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download">link
</a> and choose the Community Edition.
</p>
<p>
After you installed the program and clone this repository into your own computer, 
you need to enter in the IDEA, and open the file cloned. To do this, in the IDEA 
opened, go in <i>File</i>, on the top left, then click <i>Open</i>, and in the 
window, find where you cloned the repository and open it. After that
it might start downloading some Gradle files, and you might need to install the 
the <i>JDK</i>(Java Development Kit) 16 too, but the IDEA do it all automatically.
